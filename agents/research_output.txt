Global warming refers to the long-term warming of the planet due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel consumption, deforestation, and industrial processes. This phenomenon has led to significant changes in climate patterns, with effects such as rising sea levels, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and impacts on ecosystems and wildlife. Scientists have warned that without significant action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the consequences of global warming could lead to irreversible damage to the planet's climate system.
