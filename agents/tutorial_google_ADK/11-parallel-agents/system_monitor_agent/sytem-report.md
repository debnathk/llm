# System Health Report

## Executive Summary

Overall, the system is functioning adequately, but there are some areas of concern, specifically regarding disk space. CPU usage is low, and memory usage is moderate. However, the `/System/Volumes/Data` and `/private/var/folders/...` partitions are nearing full capacity, which could lead to performance issues. Addressing these storage concerns is highly recommended.

## CPU System Report

Here is a summary of your CPU status:

*   **Cores:** You have 10 physical cores and 10 logical cores.
*   **Usage:** The average CPU usage is 7.9%. Individual core usage ranges from 0.0% to 33.3%.
*   **Performance Concerns:** No performance concerns were detected.

**Recommendation:** The CPU is operating efficiently. No action is required.

## Memory Information Report

**Total Memory:** 16.00 GB
**Available Memory:** 3.73 GB

**Memory Usage:** 76.7%

**Swap Memory:**
*   Total: 0.00 GB
*   Used: 0.00 GB
*   Usage: 0.0%

**Recommendation:** Memory usage is relatively high but within acceptable limits. Monitor memory usage and close unnecessary applications if performance degrades. Since swap is not being used, adding more RAM might not be necessary at this time, but keep an eye on memory usage trends.

## Disk Information Report

This report provides an overview of the current disk usage on your system.

### Partition Information:

The system has a total of 10 partitions. Key partitions include:

*   `/`: This partition is at 29.5% capacity.
*   `/System/Volumes/Data`: This partition is at **88.1%** capacity.
*   `/private/var/folders/j3/1wdf4mhj6435_zgv9s5g_rl00000gn/T/AppTranslocation/06B22111-3290-4B07-94AF-5D3E6134B47D`: This partition is at **86.8%** capacity.
*   `/Volumes/TOSHIBA EXT`: This partition is at 72.7% capacity.

### Storage Capacity and Usage:

*   **Total Space:** 2302.62 GB
*   **Used Space:** 1061.95 GB
*   **Overall Usage:** 46.12%

### Storage Concerns:

The following partitions are nearing capacity:

*   `/System/Volumes/Data` (88.1%): This partition is critically full. Consider freeing up space.
*   `/private/var/folders/j3/1wdf4mhj6435_zgv9s5g_rl00000gn/T/AppTranslocation/06B22111-3290-4B07-94AF-5D3E6134B47D` (86.8%): This partition is nearly full, which can impact performance.

**Recommendations:**

*   **`/System/Volumes/Data`:** Immediately free up space on this partition. This partition is where your user data resides. Consider moving large files to external storage or deleting unnecessary files.
*   **`/private/var/folders/...`:** This partition is used for temporary application data. Clearing caches and temporary files may help. This directory often contains application translocation data, so ensure that applications are correctly installed and not running from temporary locations.
*   **`/Volumes/TOSHIBA EXT`:** While not critically full, monitor the usage of the `/Volumes/TOSHIBA EXT` partition. If it continues to fill up, consider archiving or deleting old files.
